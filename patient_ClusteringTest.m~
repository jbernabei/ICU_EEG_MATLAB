%This function takes in a specific patient, figures out which of the
%training set clusters they belong in using Data2Cluster, and then uses the
%model from the ModelArray that corresponds to that cluster's index. Note
%that this method needs to be handed an array that included all of the
%pretrained models, and that makes use of a function, Data2Cluster, that
%deals largely with persistent variables, and thus has implicitly been run
%on training data before this function is called.
